# validator-logos
Repository to store validator logos
* The validators logos will be used by several clients such as Harmony staking explorer when displaying the list of validators.


## Steps to add your logo
* Fork this repository
* Add your logo by creating the logo image name using your Harmony one-address and placing it inside `validators/`, e.g. `validators/one1pdv9lrdwl0rg5vglh4xtyrv3wjk3wsqket7zxy.jpg`
* Append your validator's basic information (including address, name, description and website) to the bottom of the list.json,

For example, append yours to the last lines of [list.json](https://github.com/harmony-one/validator-logos/blob/master/list.json)

```

    "website": "https://harmony.one"
},
```
